\title{Search for Himawari-8/9 satellite data on NCI THREDDS}
\usage{
fire_himawari_search(fire_bbox, start_time, end_time, timestep_minutes = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{fire_bbox}{An \code{sf} polygon that defines the spatial search area (e.g., your fire boundary or bounding box).}

\item{start_time}{A \code{POSIXct} date-time (local time) marking the beginning of the search window. Converted to UTC internally.}

\item{end_time}{A \code{POSIXct} date-time (local time) marking the end of the search window. Converted to UTC internally.}

\item{timestep_minutes}{Timestep in minutes for selecting imagery (must be a multiple of 10). E.g., \code{10} for every image or \code{60} for hourly checks.}
}
\value{
A data frame with available file names, UTC and local times, download URLs, bands, and satellite names.
If no data is found, a message is printed and \code{NULL} is returned.
}
\description{
This function searches the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) Himawari 8 and 9 satellite image archives
hosted on the NCI THREDDS server: \url{https://geonetwork.nci.org.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/f8433_0020_1861_5916}.

It finds file paths for imagery covering the specified fire bounding box and time range.
Himawari images are available every 10 minutes; use a larger timestep to reduce the volume of results.
For recent fires (within ~3 weeks), near real-time (NRT) data will also be searched automatically.

The output is a data frame listing the file paths for all available band Ã— time combinations.
