\usage{
fire_max_spread_line(
  polygons,
  time_col,
  include_spots = F,
  include_backburns = F,
  convex_hull = T,
  max_only = T,
  internal_only = F,
  min_minutes = 20,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{polygons}{Fire polygons sf object}

\item{time_col}{Name of date time column (posix)}

\item{include_spots}{T/F to include spot fire in spread line creation. Data must have firetype column populated with "spot", "main" or "backburn"}

\item{include_backburns}{T/F to include backburns in spread line creation. Data must have firetype column populated with "spot", "main" or "backburn"}

\item{convex_hull}{T/F whether to convert fire polygon to convex hull first}

\item{max_only}{T/F return only the max spread line}

\item{internal_only}{T/F return only lines completely within the fire polygon at time 2}

\item{min_minutes}{minimum time interval between progressions}

\item{max_minutes}{maximum time interval between progression}

\item{densify_m}{metres between vertices on polygon edge from which to measure spread}
