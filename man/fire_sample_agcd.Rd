\title{Sample monthly precipitation from AGCD (Australian Gridded Climate Data)}
\usage{
fire_sample_agcd(dat, time_utc_col, buffer_m)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{An \code{sf} object with geometry column and a POSIXct time column in UTC.}

\item{time_utc_col}{Character name of the column in \code{dat} containing the time.}

\item{buffer_m}{Numeric. Buffer distance in meters around the geometry to sample grid points.}
}
\value{
A data frame with mean, min, max, and median precipitation statistics
for each feature and the date sampled.
}
\description{
This function samples monthly total precipitation values from the AGCD
gridded dataset for a set of spatial features with associated timestamps.
It matches each feature's date to the appropriate NetCDF file on the
NCI THREDDS server, extracts the relevant grid cells, and computes
basic precipitation summaries within a buffer around each feature.
